# Eugene Maning's GitHub.io Website

This is the source code for my personal GitHub Pages website. The site displays my recent GitHub activity and provides links to my professional profiles.

## Features

- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Displays recent GitHub commits from my repositories
- Links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles
- Modern, clean user interface

## Technical Implementation

This website is built using:

- HTML5
- CSS3 with responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript
- GitHub API for fetching commit data

## How It Works

The website uses the GitHub API to fetch my most recently updated repositories and their commits. It then displays this information in an easy-to-read format. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Setup

1. Fork this repository
2. Update the GitHub username in `script.js` to your own
3. Update the LinkedIn URL in `index.html` to your own
4. Customize the design by modifying `styles.css`
5. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings to deploy

## Deployment

This site is deployed using GitHub Pages. Any commits to the main branch will automatically be deployed.

## License

This project is open source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
